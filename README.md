# A software where you can make Yomiyama Humino talk

Kind of a long name, but that will do.

## What works

* Inputting text as hiragana makes Humino talk, that's it
* She also can blink and move her mouth, amazing

## What doesn't work

* Inputting text as romaji, katakana or kanji won't work
* Small characters don't work either (I had an idea for the small tsu character, but trying to figure out how to handle every other character was too much work for my small brain)

## What's in the future for this little experiment?

I don't know. 
If you want you can download the source and do whatever you want with it.
You're going to have to read my code though, good luck with that.
